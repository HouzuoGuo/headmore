.SH INPUT QUIRKS

While nearly all keyboard input will be successfully sent to VNC desktop, there are however several quirks to bear in mind:

.IP \[bu]
If you have a computer mouse and your terminal emulator somehow forwards mouse clicks to headmore, headmore may do random things or quit unexpectedly.
.IP \[bu]
All modifier keys only work with lower case letters a-z. For other combinations such as Alt+F4, toggle hold Alt key and then type F4 in VNC.
.IP \[bu]
While most control characters such as Ctrl+C and Ctrl+D work reliably in VNC input, a few of them (such as Ctrl+Z) do not work in certain terminal emulators, you have to toggle hold control key and then press the other character individually.

.SH DESIGN RATIONALE
.B headmore
uses LibVNCClient (from LibVNCServer project) to connect to server in 32bit RGB colour mode, a colour space so deep helps dithering algorithm to produce smooth image; connection will still succeed even if server cannot offer 32bit colours.

If the VNC server is secured by password authentication, password entry will be prompted before establishing connection, this security mechanism is also known as "VncAuth". Unfortunately the client cannot yet perform certificate based authentication, which is also known as "X509Vnc".

Dithering of VNC image, terminal drawing, and keyboard interactivity are provided by libcaca (from Caca Labs). The latest image from VNC are drawn (dithered) on terminal at a constant frame rate of approximately 10FPS using Floyd-Steinberg algorithm. The terminal does not redraw in presence of keyboard input.

Somewhat verbose messages from LibVNCClient and headmore are placed here, might come in handy for debugging connection troubles.
